You may have heard of the game or concept of “Six Degrees of Separation” or “Six
Degrees of Kevin Bacon.” The idea in the latter is that any actor in any movie can be
linked to Kevin Bacon through a series of actors that appeared in a movie together. For
example, Ian McKellen (who played Gandalf in the “Lord of the Rings” trilogy) was
in “The DaVinci Code” with Tom Hanks, who was in “Apollo 13” with Kevin Bacon.
Supposedly all actors can be linked back to Kevin Bacon in no more than six links.
In this problem, program input is a list of movies and the set of actors that appeared
together. The program needs to find a chain of no more than three links (rather than six,
to keep the input files of a reasonable size) that connects two given names (not necessarily
Kevin Bacon). Each line is in the format: “<Movie> <List of actors>”. Input files will
look something like this example:
Apollo13 Kevin Bacon Tom Hanks Gary Sinise
HollowMan Elisabeth Shue Kevin Bacon Josh Brolin
AFewGoodMen Tom Cruise Demi Moore Jack Nicholson Kevin Bacon
OneCrazySummer John Cusack Demi Moore
DaVinciCode Tom Hanks Ian McKellen Audrey Tautou
