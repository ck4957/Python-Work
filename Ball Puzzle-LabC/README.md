Consider the following puzzle: you are given an arbitrary number of balls of three colors:
red, green and blue. You are also given three cans that are identical, except that one can
is labelled ‘red’, one ‘green’, and one ‘blue’. Each can is capable of holding all or some
of the balls, and open at just one end. The cans are just wide enough that the balls can
slide in, but once inside, they can’t move around - they stay in the same order that they
were put in. Initially, all the balls are in the ‘red’ can.
The only operation allowed is that you may pour any number of balls out of one can and
directly into another. You may repeat this operation as many times as necessary. Your
goal is to end up with each can (‘red’, ‘green’, ‘blue’) containing only balls of its respective
color. Furthermore, you should try to accomplish this in as few moves as possible. A move
is defined as a single ball leaving one can and entering a different can.
